aboutDescription:
Welcome to my page. I am Vaibhav Setia. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University. I am actively looking for Summer'23 internship opportunities for SWE/SDE roles.
I am open to work in hybrid as well as in-person setting. My job preference is simply to work with an employer who values their employees.
